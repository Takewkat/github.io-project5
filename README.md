This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Open html files ###

Open .html files with Live Server please

The task is to write Javascript for the frontend. I can't use frameworks and libraries in this project.
My code is in the front/js folder, the rest of the code is written by Openclassroom teachers =)
